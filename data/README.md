This folder contains the data used for this project. 

<code>qgis</code> contains the shapefiles of all reaches, past river interventions in the lower Jamuna River, and other geographical data. (to be updated soon)
\
<code>satellite</code> contains the original satellite images retrieved from [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) for the Jamuna, Ganges, Ghangara and Indus rivers in the folder named 'original'. Each river folder contains separate 'preprocessing' and 'averages' folders, which are nescessary for the model to load in the sets of images.
